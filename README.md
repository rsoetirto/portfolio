# Portfolio

Hi, my name is Rania. It's nice to e-meet you!

I'm currently a M.S. Business Analytics candidate at the USC Marshall School of Business. 
This portfolio showcases my coding projects, spanning from optimization to the execution of statistical tests like linear regression, multilinear regression, and more. 
I have acquired proficiency in Python, SQL, and R, and have hands-on experience using Excel for conducting statistical analyses and PowerBI to conduct visualizations. 

Fun fact about me, I used to work as a journalist before pursuing analytics. 
You can find my work at mainstream news platforms such as NBC News, Today.com, and also The Nation.
